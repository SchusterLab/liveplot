liveplot.py
===========

liveplot is a system for minimal hassle, on-the-fly, dataset visualization in
python. If you want maximum customizability, or plot types other than line plots
and image plots, look elsewhere. But if you just want to see your data as it
comes in to your script, with minimal effort, and without the possibility of
graphics bugs crashing your script, this might be for you.

Liveplot works in two
processes, one of which is a pyqt application hosting the window, the other is
your script, which sends data to the window over a named pipe. The intended
workflow is to open the window once (per session) and keep it open, rather than
restarting it for every run of the script. Ideally, multiple scripts can
communicate with the same window, and data remains available in the window until
it is overwritten.

Requirements
------------
- Numpy
- [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
- [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org)

pyqtgraph will be installed automatically from PyPI if not found

Basic Usage
-----------

Install from PyPI

    pip install liveplot

or from the source directory

    python setup.py install

and start the window

    python -m liveplot

on windows, if you have py2exe, build the executable

    python setup.py 
    
which should produce `dist/liveplot.exe`

If the window has been successfully started, open a client and plot

```python
from liveplot import LivePlotClient
import numpy as np
plotter = LivePlotClient()
xs = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
plotter.plot_xy('my test data', xs, np.sin(xs))
```

Individual plots are specified by their name, which can be any unique string.
Attempting to create two different types of plot with the same name is currently
an error. See more examples with the test suite, 

    python liveplot_test.py

Several methods of plotting are supported, including cumulative, parametric, and 2D-Image.

OS X Setup
----------
By default Macs restrict the size of shared memory that can be allocated to a
single process. To overcome this, copy `sysctl.conf` to `/etc`, or append it if
the file is already present. Reboot your system to apply the changes.



GUI Features
------------
In addition to the many wonderful features of native pyqtgraph widgets we have,

- Double click on plots to bring up cross-hair marker
- Cross-hair displays cross-section cuts for image plots
- Restore closed plots by double-clicking the name in the plot list
- Focus on a single plot by maximizing
- Right click on image plots
  - toggle histogram & levels scale
  - enable/disable auto-rescaling of levels when image is updated
